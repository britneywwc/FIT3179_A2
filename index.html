        <b>consume some sort of caffeine every day</b>, making it the most widely used psychoactive drug on Earth (Pollan 2021).
        <br> This is mainly because caffeine heavily impacts an individual's mood and drive for the day. 
        <br> <b><span style="color: rgb(73, 25, 25);">Coffee</span></b> is one of the

        A total of USD 19 billion of coffee exports were recorded in 2017, which also provided jobs for 125 million people 
        (Voora et al., 2019).

          As seen in the donut chart, <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Brazil, Vietnam </span>and 
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Colombia </span> are the <b>top 3 coffee exporting countries in 2018. </b>
          Coffee export impact on country's economic growth. The total coffee production of each country is in thousand 60 kg bags.
          <br>
          
          <br>
          A study done by The Brazil Business states that coffee beans made up 10.2% of Brazil's exported commodities in 2011.
          This shows that the coffee exporting industry is an essential agribusiness for the people of Brazil and also the rest of the coffee drinkers in the world.

          Arabica and Robusta coffee are the most popular type of coffee beans. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%; color: red;">Brazil</span> is the 
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: brown;">top coffee producer for Arabica</span> whereas
          <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%; color: red;">Vietnam</span> tops the list for <span style="font-weight: bold; color: brown;">Robusta production</span>. 
          Brazilian Naturals represent Arabica coffee whereas Robusta represents itself. 
          <br><br>
          Both coffee beans show a similar trend in the fluctuations of coffee prices throughout the years. A significant observation
          is that <b>Brazilian Naturals (Arabica)</b> coffee is <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green;">more expensive </span>compared to Robusta. 
          <br><br>
          The price disparity between the two coffee is because Arabica coffee requires more delicate and specific cultivation requirements,
          such as weather and altitude to grow. Robusta on the other hand is easier to care for due to its adaptability to adverse weather and
          natural diseases.          
          Arabica coffee tend to be sweeter due to the nature of the tree, whereas Robusta contains the most caffeine out of all coffee types.

        <div class="desc">
          <span style="color: red; font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold;">80%</span> of the world's coffee is produced by <b>smallholders</b> which are people, 
          families who own small parcels of lands. An average coffee farmer <b>only earns a living income </b>which is sufficient to provide food and shelter for their families.
          Before a consumer gets their coffee, there is a long coffee supply chain all the way from the farm. Each step along the long
          process takes away a percentage of the coffee earnings from the farmers.

          From the chart above, it shows that <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Dominican Republic</span> coffee farmers are the <b>most paid </b>as of 2013.
          Farmers in <span style="font-weight: bold; color: brown;">Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: brown;">Uganda </span>are also <b>paid better</b> than other farmers.
          <br><br>
          There are ongoing efforts by coffee vendors to combat the wage inequality in coffee farmers.
          Single Origin coffee is a process directly from farm to consumer where the beans are picked by hand by workers who are
          paid a fair wage. Due to the nature of this coffee process, the prices of Single Origin coffee tend to be higher compared to normal
          blended coffee.
          <br><br>
          So the next time you have the opportunity to try Single Origin coffee, know that your decision will help
          aid local coffee farmers. Besides, you will get to know all the unique characteristics and specific taste profiles
          of your coffee.

            <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%;">Luxembourg</span> is the <b>top coffee consumer</b> out of all the selected countries. The coffee scale for Luxembourg
            is approaching severe. This can be due to the small population of Luxembourg and how it is surrounded by
            high coffee consuming Nordic countries such as Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
            <br><br>
            It can clearly be seen that <span style="font-weight:bold; color: brown">Nordic countries </span>as mentioned are also <b>heavy coffee consumers.</b> 
            This is due to the higher taxes that Nordic countries have on alcohol and alcohol production, which means that coffee was
            the more accessible option for most Scandinavians. It is also Nordic custom to offer coffee in almost everywhere,
            so much as it is more commonly offered than water. This explains why <b>Nordic countries consume the most coffee
            in the world.</b>
